(For Axxess Hackathon 2023)

1. server.py file contains the (flask) REST API link for disease prediction and symptom co-occurrence generator.
2. lr_model.py contains the logistic regression classifier model training and is used to dump the trained model as a pickle file 'model.pkl' (inside ./flsk_api)

Post:

- a request with a list of user-generated symptoms to <http://localhost:5000/symptom> to get a list with additional probable symptoms appended.
- a request with a list of indices generated by user selection when relevant symptoms are given in addition to the symptoms already posted to <http://localhost:5000/topindices> to get back a response containing a tuple of symptoms with their co-occurrence strength.
- a request with an array created by presenting the tuple data to the user in order to refine the symptoms to <http://localhost:5000/pred> and get the disease predicted.
